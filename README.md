## What is Ducho

Ducho is a Python framework for the extraction of multimodal features for recommendation. It provides a unified interface to most of the common libraries for deep learning (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Transformers) to extract high-level features from items (e.g., product images/descriptions) and user-item interactions (e.g., users reviews). It is highly configurable through a YAML-based configuration file (which may be override by input arguments from the command line.
